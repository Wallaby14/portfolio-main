                    I do plan on going to college, if I can I would like to take part in an exchange program to Japan
                    during one of my years at college. I want to go to college for Cybersecurity or as a Software Engineer.
                    I think that I will only go to college for 4 years to get my bachelors because I plan on attending Co op while in high school
                    to make money and get experience with a real world job in this career line.

                    Another option I have thought about exploring are joining the military as a Cybersecurity agent. From here I would do 4
                    years with the army and then go to college after that for a business Cybersecurity career. This would help get my foot in the
                    door for a Cybersecurity career line which would be super helpful down the road.
