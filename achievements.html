            <p>
                My sophomore year of highschool I was given the opportunity to take a Google Certification as a intro
                level IT Specialist.
                I passed the course and gained many skills. Some of the more important skills I learned were Linux,
                Windows, Troubleshooting,
                Networking, Directory Services, Cybersecurity, and VPN's/Proxies. There were other skills that I learned
                however I will put a full
                at the bottom of this page for anyone interested.
