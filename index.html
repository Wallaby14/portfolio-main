                Hello I am Wyatt Allaby and this is my professional website I made.
                This is a website to store all of my acomplishments and different 
                experience I have with programming. For the most part I like to do
                anything I can with many languages and projects however I do have a
                few that I prefer to use. I made this to show the various projects that
                I have done over the years.
